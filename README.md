# STEP 2020 Capstone Project

WikiLoop [product name] will address the issue of incivility between 
editors within edit comments on Wikipedia. The tool will keep track 
of potential incivil edit comments by sending comments that have a 
high percentage of toxicity to a dashboard for users to review. Users 
will be able to view their potentially toxic comments and understand why 
their comments were flagged for review. Our hope is that this tool utilizes 
the self-governed nature of Wikipedia such that editors will keep other 
editors accountable for their language, thus ensuring Wikipediaâ€™s pillar 
of respect and civility is upheld on the platform.
